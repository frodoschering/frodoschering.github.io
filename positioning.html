		<h1>Container rotation and position modifications</h1>
		<p>[Introduction]</p>
		<h2>Free rotation</h2>
		<p>When swiping on mobile the bottom sheet with modifications slides down and the container can be freely rotated. Clicking or swiping the panel up slides the bottom sheet up again.  </p>

		<h2>Lock orientation</h2>
		<p>
		When the bottom sheet is active we can lock the container orientation in certain sections for better control over positioning modifications. This way the user can not accidentally rotate the container while positioning. The user can still switch to free rotation mode at any time. When the bottom sheet is made active again the container locks back into place.

		<h2>Modification placement</h2>
		<p>
		Adding a modification can be done by either clicking a modification card or dragging and dropping a modification card onto the container. A placed modification can be selected by tapping it. When a modification is selected a button appears to position the modification. This button is added on mobile so the modification is not obscured by the users finger and the touch area is always big enough even with when modifications are small. An info card also appears for exact positioning and deleting the modification.
